# MultiSFC
MultiSFC is a projcet that aims at providing low latency and high availability for multi-service networks.

This project includes the following technologies:
- Service Function Chaining (SFC) based multi-service network architecture
- Low latency transport mechanisms (e.g. flow scheduling and load balancing) for multi-service networks
- High availability mechanisms (e.g. loss-aware packet forwarding and rapid loss recovery) for multi-service networks
